# Samarth - Large scale placement platform
Samarth uses technology to organise Skill & Job marketplace by covering large amount of population to its skill database and Job database. 

Samarth does what UBER did to Taxi based transportation, to skilled people recruitment across all possible industry and service segments of India
This is done by organising Skilled people finding for a job of any industry and/or service segment as a well organised, predictable, trustable and reliable online marketplace 

Hence Samarth can be viewed as a large database of skilled people, jobs currently available, past placement history and outcomes from the placement history, with intelligence to identify next successful placement for either job provider or skilled people

### Challenges being solved
- Organise skill recruitment across all industry segments, especially focusing Indian ecosystem
- Finding right skill for a opening is too time consuming and frustrating
- Mutual issues in visibility of Career openings and Skilled people
- Mutual Confidence deficit among Candidates, Career openings and employers
- Job matching is the beginning of a successful placement, for finding next successful candidate or career opening, current placement has to be tracked for outcome from perspective of both Candidate and Job provider 
- Introducing a coordinator role in middle to facilitate placement, track placement status and follow up if there is a inactivity on either side (candidate, job provider)
- Because coordinator is involved, we have to ensure coordinators effort is best utilized and scaled to large number of candidates and openings and keep the required number of coordinator minimal
- Language barriers have to be crossed, if Samarth needs to cover all industry segments, large number of skilled people, geographical locations and openings
- Intuitive and forgiving user interface is needed as it is expected to be used by large number people with varied level of familiarity with computer interfaces
- As coordinators are involved, there is a implicit middleman in the process of placement, which demands transparency among coordinators, among job providers and skilled people. Transparency has to be default nature of the app
- System aiding is needed in all the steps of the process so that manual efforts can be reduced and mistakes can be avoided to possible extent and constantly improved
