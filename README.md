# Samarth - Large scale placement platform
Samarth uses technology to solve Skill & Job deficit by covering large amount of population to its skill database and Job database. Hence Samarth can be viewed as a large database of skilled people, jobs currently available, past placement history and outcomes from the placement history, with intelligence to identify next successful placement for either job provider or skilled people

### Challenges being solved
- Finding right skill for a opening is too time consuming and frustrating
- Mutual issues in visibility of Career openings and Skills
- Mutual Confidence deficit among Candidate and Career openings
- Job matching is the beginning of a successful placement, for finding next successful candidate or career opening, current placement has to be tracked for outcome from perspective of both Candidate and Job provider 
- Need a coordinator in middle to facilitate placement, track placement status and follow up if there is a inactivity on either side
- Because coordinator is involved, we have to ensure coordinators effort is best utilized and scaled to large number of candidates and openings
- Language barriers have to be crossed, if Samarth needs to cover large number of skilled people and openings
- Intuitive and forgiving user interface is needed as it is expected to be used by large number people with varied level of familiarity with computer interfaces
- As coordinators are involved, there is a implicit middleman in the process of placement, which demands transparency among coordinators, among job providers and skilled people. Transparency has to be default nature of the app
- System aiding is needed in all the steps of the process so that manual efforts can be reduced and mistakes can be avoided to possible extent and constantly improved
